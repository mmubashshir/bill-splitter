## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had a great learning of DOM, since it involved capturing of different input and updating the tip and total bill amount per person. Also made efforts to know about the event listeners in detail. I wasnot sure how to make a custom styled input, had a little understanding around styles for input.
